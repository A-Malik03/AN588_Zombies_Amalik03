## Original Code Reflection
I enjoyed most of this homework, but some of it was a struggle. I really enjoyed trying to figure out how to make my own functions despite how frustrating it was. I struggled with question 6 because I misread the question and was trying to plot at 100 X 30 data points into a vector of vectors but realized I only needed the means of each random sample. I also struggled with finding a way to add to vectors. I used the internet and found the function "append" to make changes to a vector. Finally I needed to refresh my memory on how to analyze qq plots because I didn't know how to use the graph. I reread Module 8 to grab a better understanding of quantile-quantile plots and its uses.I didn't use the full capabilities of ggplot2 because I wanted to make sure I did the homework correctly. I plan on adding color and prettiness for the final submission.

## Final Code Reflection
Ritika's comments and review of my code really helped me improve and find errors in my homework assignment. I realized through her comments and my peer commentary on Jess's code that I didn't do Question 5 right. Additionally, in question 3, when a scatter plot between weight in relation to age, Ritika believes there is a weak positive correlation. I personally think there is no relation but I used the corr.test function from Module 12 to find the correlation coefficient and changed my answer because there is indeed a weak correlation. Finally, based on Jess's code, I realized left and right skewed is not a distribution, it's a description of the graph, so I had to change my explanations for question 4. I also focused my final code on clarifying my explanations as well as making all my plots pretty.

## 1. Calculate the population mean and standard deviation for each quantitative random variable (height, weight, age, number of zombies killed, and years of education).
```{r}
library(curl)
library(tidyverse)

f <-curl("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fuzzyatelin/fuzzyatelin.github.io/master/AN588_Fall23/zombies.csv")
d <-read.csv(f, header = TRUE, sep = ",", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
head(d) #make sure it's set up right
(mean.height <- mean(d$height))
(mean.weight <- mean(d$weight))
(mean.age <- mean(d$weight))
(mean.kills <- mean(d$zombies_killed))
(mean.edu <- mean(d$years_of_education))


pop.sd <- function(x){ #create a function for population SD
  sqrt(
    sum(
      (x - mean(x))^2
    )
    / length(x)
  )
}
(height.sd <- pop.sd(d$height))
(weight.sd <- pop.sd(d$weight))
(age.sd <- pop.sd(d$age))
(kills.sd <- pop.sd(d$zombies_killed))
(edu.sd <- pop.sd(d$years_of_education))


```

## 2. Use {ggplot} to make boxplots of each of these variables by gender.
```{r}
heightplot <- ggplot(data = d, aes(x = gender, y = height, fill = gender)) + geom_boxplot() + xlab("Gender") + ylab("Height(inches)") + labs(title = "Boxplot of Height by Gender") + theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust =0.5)) 
heightplot
#Followed Jess's code to center the titles. THANKS JESS!

```
```{r}
weightplot <- ggplot(data = d, aes(x = gender, y = weight, fill = gender)) + geom_boxplot() + xlab("Gender") + ylab("Weight(pounds)") + labs(title = "Boxplot of Weight by Gender") + theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust =0.5)) 
weightplot
```
```{r}
ageplot <- ggplot(data = d, aes(x = gender, y = age, fill = gender)) + geom_boxplot() + xlab("Gender") + ylab("Age(years)") + labs(title = "Boxplot of Weight by Gender") + theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust =0.5)) 
ageplot
```
```{r}
killsplot <- ggplot(data = d, aes(x = gender, y = zombies_killed, fill = gender)) + geom_boxplot() + xlab("Gender") + ylab("Zombies Killed") + labs(title = "Boxplot of Weight by Gender") + theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust =0.5)) 
killsplot
```
```{r}
eduplot <- ggplot(data = d, aes(x = gender, y = years_of_education, fill = gender)) + geom_boxplot() + xlab("Gender") + ylab("Years of Education") + labs(title = "Boxplot of Weight by Gender") + theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust =0.5)) 
eduplot
```
## 3. Use {ggplot} to make scatterplots of height and weight in relation to age. Do these variables seem to be related? In what way?
```{r}
scatplotheight <- ggplot(data = d, aes(x = age, y = height)) + geom_point(colour = "brown4") + xlab("Age(years)") + ylab("Height(in)") + labs(title = "Relationship Between Age and Height") + theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust =0.5)) 
scatplotheight
(cor.test(d$age, d$height))
```
<br>According to the scatterplot, there is a moderate positive correlation between the ages and the height of the survivors because the Pearson correlation coefficient is calculates to be 0.648.<br>
```{r scatplotheight}
scatplotweight <- ggplot(data = d, aes(x = age, y = weight)) + geom_point(colour = "maroon") + xlab("Age(years)") + ylab("Weight(lb)") + labs(title = "Relationship Between Age and Weight") + theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust =0.5)) 
scatplotweight
(cor.test(d$age, d$weight))
```
<br>According to the scatter plot, there is a weak positive relationship between the age of survivors and their weight because the Pearson correlation coefficient is calculated to be 0.320.<br>


## 4. Using histograms and Q-Q plots, check whether the quantitative variables seem to be drawn from a normal distribution. Which seem to be and which do not (hint: not all are drawn from the normal distribution)? For those that are not normal, can you determine from which common distribution they are drawn?
```{r}

plot.hist.qq <- function(Variable){ #Made function to plot histogram and qqplot to make plotting easier
  par(mfrow = c(1,2))
  plot(hist(Variable, plot = FALSE), col = "maroon", main = c("Histogram of Variable")) #Plots a basic histogram of variable y
  qqnorm(Variable, frame = FALSE, col = "brown") #Plots a qq graph of data points
  qqline(Variable) #plots a qq line 
}
plot.hist.qq(d$height)
```
<br> Yes, based on the histogram and the qqplot, the height of the survivors are drawn from a normal distribution curve.<br>

```{r}
plot.hist.qq(d$weight)
```
<br>Yes, based on the histogram and the qqplot, the weight of the survivors are drawn from a normal distribution curve.<br>

```{r}
plot.hist.qq(d$age)
```
<br>Yes, based on the histogram and the qqplot, the age of the survivors are drawn from a normal distribution curve.<br>

```{r}
plot.hist.qq(d$zombies_killed)
```
<br>No, based on the graphs, the data does not stem from a normal distributions. The graph can be described as right-skewed. I predict that the data is pulled from a Poisson distribution.<br>
```{r}
plot.hist.qq(d$years_of_education)
```
<br>No, the data for survivors' years of education is not drawn from a normal distribution. The graph can be described as right-skewed. I predict that the data is pulled from a Poisson distribution.<br>


## 5. Now use the sample() function to sample ONE subset of 30 zombie survivors (without replacement) from this population and calculate the mean and sample standard deviation for each variable. Also estimate the standard error for each variable, and construct the 95% confidence interval for each mean. Note that for the variables that are not drawn from the normal distribution, you may need to base your estimate of the CIs on slightly different code than for the normal.
```{r normal distr}
(samplesized <- sample_n(d, size = 30, replace = FALSE))
(mean.height.s <- mean(samplesized$height))
(mean.weight.s <- mean(samplesized$weight))
(mean.age.s <- mean(samplesized$age))
(mean.kills.s <- mean(samplesized$zombies_killed))
(mean.edu.s <- mean(samplesized$years_of_education))

(sd.height.s <- pop.sd(samplesized$height))
(sd.weight.s <- pop.sd(samplesized$weight))
(sd.age.s <- pop.sd(samplesized$age))
(sd.kills.s <- pop.sd(samplesized$zombies_killed))
(sd.edu.s <- pop.sd(samplesized$years_of_education))

standarderror <- function(sd) {
  sd/sqrt(30)
}

(semheight <- standarderror(sd.height.s))
(semweight <-standarderror(sd.weight.s))
(semage <-standarderror(sd.age.s))
(semkills <-standarderror(sd.kills.s))
(semedu <-standarderror(sd.edu.s))
  
xbar = NULL
sd= NULL
normbounds <- function(xbar, sem){
  lower.bound <- xbar - qnorm(1-0.05/2) * sem
  upper.bound <- xbar + qnorm(1-0.05/2) * sem
  print(c(lower.bound, upper.bound))
}
  
normbounds(mean.height.s, sd.height.s)
normbounds(mean.weight.s, sd.weight.s)
normbounds(mean.age.s, sd.age.s)

#Made bounds function using Module 9
```
```{r not norm dist}
poisbounds <- function(x){
  poisson.test(length(x))
}
poisbounds(mean.kills.s)
poisbounds(mean.edu.s)
```

## 6. Now draw 99 more random samples of 30 zombie apocalypse survivors, and calculate the mean for each variable for each of these samples. Together with the first sample you drew, you now have a set of 100 means for each variable (each based on 30 observations), which constitutes a sampling distribution for each variable. What are the means and standard deviations of this distribution of means for each variable? How do the standard deviations of means compare to the standard errors estimated in [5]? What do these sampling distributions look like (a graph might help here)? Are they normally distributed? What about for those variables that you concluded were not originally drawn from a normal distribution?
```{r}
meanheights <- c(mean.height.s)
meanweights <- c(mean.weight.s)
meanages <- c(mean.age.s)
meankills <- c(mean.kills.s)
meanedus <- c(mean.edu.s)



for (i in 1:99) { #create a for loop that adds the mean vectors of the quantitative daae to a vector of means, a total of 99 loops for 100 samples.
  rsample <- sample_n(d, size = 30, replace = FALSE)
  meanheights <- append(meanheights, mean(rsample$height))
  meanweights <- append(meanweights, mean(rsample$weight))
   meanages <- append(meanages, mean(rsample$age))
   meankills <- append(meankills, mean(rsample$zombies_killed))
   meanedus <- append(meanedus, mean(rsample$years_of_education))
}

mean(meanheights)
pop.sd(meanheights) #Use pop.sd because this set of 30 is our sample
mean(meanweights)
pop.sd(meanweights)
mean(meanages)
pop.sd(meanages)
mean(meankills)
pop.sd(meankills)
mean(meanedus)
```

<br>The standard deviations are smaller from this population are smaller than that of the one from Question 5. Also, he standard deviation of the means are very close to the standard error calculated<br>

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
plot.hist.qq(meanheights)
plot.hist.qq(meanweights)
plot.hist.qq(meanages)
plot.hist.qq(meankills)
plot.hist.qq(meanedus)
```
<br>Based on the histograms and qq plots, all the quantitative data seem to be drawn from a normal distribution.<br>
