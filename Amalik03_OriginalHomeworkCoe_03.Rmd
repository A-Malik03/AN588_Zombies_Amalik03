## Reflection
I enjoyed most of this homework, but some of it was a struggle. I really enjoyed trying to figure out how to make my own functions despite how frustrating it was. I struggled with question 6 because I misread the question and was trying to plot at 100 X 30 data points into a vector of vectors but realized I only needed the means of each random sample. I also struggled with finding a way to add to vectors. I used the internet and found the function "append" to make changes to a vector. Finally I needed to refresh my memory on how to analyze qq plots because I didn't know how to use the graph. I reread Module 8 to grab a better understanding of quantile-quantile plots and its uses.I didn't use the full capabilities of ggplot2 because I wanted to make sure I did the homework correctly. I plan on adding color and prettiness for the final submission.


## 1. Calculate the population mean and standard deviation for each quantitative random variable (height, weight, age, number of zombies killed, and years of education).
```{r}
library(curl)
library(tidyverse)

f <-curl("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fuzzyatelin/fuzzyatelin.github.io/master/AN588_Fall23/zombies.csv")
d <-read.csv(f, header = TRUE, sep = ",", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
head(d) #make sure it's set up right
(mean.height <- mean(d$height))
(mean.weight <- mean(d$weight))
(mean.age <- mean(d$weight))
(mean.kills <- mean(d$zombies_killed))
(mean.edu <- mean(d$years_of_education))


pop.sd <- function(x){ #create a function for population SD
  sqrt(
    sum(
      (x - mean(x))^2
    )
    / length(x)
  )
}
(height.sd <- pop.sd(d$height))
(weight.sd <- pop.sd(d$weight))
(age.sd <- pop.sd(d$age))
(kills.sd <- pop.sd(d$zombies_killed))
(edu.sd <- pop.sd(d$years_of_education))


```

## 2. Use {ggplot} to make boxplots of each of these variables by gender.
```{r}
heightplot <- ggplot(data = d, aes(x = gender, y = height)) + geom_boxplot() + xlab("Gender") + ylab("Height(inches)")
heightplot

```
```{r}
weightplot <- ggplot(data = d, aes(x = gender, y = weight)) + geom_boxplot() + xlab("Gender") + ylab("Weight(pounds)")
weightplot
```
```{r}
ageplot <- ggplot(data = d, aes(x = gender, y = age)) + geom_boxplot() + xlab("Gender") + ylab("Age(years)")
ageplot
```
```{r}
killsplot <- ggplot(data = d, aes(x = gender, y = zombies_killed)) + geom_boxplot() + xlab("Gender") + ylab("Zombies Killed")
killsplot
```



```{r}
eduplot <- ggplot(data = d, aes(x = gender, y = years_of_education)) + geom_boxplot() + xlab("Gender") + ylab("Years of Education")
eduplot
```

## 3. Use {ggplot} to make scatterplots of height and weight in relation to age. Do these variables seem to be related? In what way?
```{r}
scatplotheight <- ggplot(data = d, aes(x = age, y = height)) + geom_point() + xlab("Age") + ylab("Height(in)")
scatplotheight
```
<br>According to the scatterplot, there is a weak positive correlation between the ages and the height of the survivors.<br>
```{r scatplotheight}
scatplotweight <- ggplot(data = d, aes(x = age, y = weight)) + geom_point() + xlab("Age") + ylab("Weight(lb)")
scatplotweight
```
<br>According to the scatterplot, there is almost no relationship between the age of survivors and their weight<br>


## 4. Using histograms and Q-Q plots, check whether the quantitative variables seem to be drawn from a normal distribution. Which seem to be and which do not (hint: not all are drawn from the normal distribution)? For those that are not normal, can you determine from which common distribution they are drawn?
```{r}
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
hist(d$height) #Plots a basic histogram
qqnorm(d$height, frame = FALSE) #Plots a qqgraph of data points
qqline(d$height) #plots a qq line 
```
<br> Yes, based on the histogram and the qqplot, the height of the survivors are drawn from a normal distribution curve.<br>

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
hist(d$weight)
qqnorm(d$weight, frame = FALSE)
qqline(d$weight)
```
<br>Yes, based on the histogram and the qqplot, the weight of the survivors are drawn from a normal distribution curve.<br>

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
hist(d$age)
qqnorm(d$age, frame = FALSE)
qqline(d$age)
```
<br>Yes, based on the histogram and the qqplot, the age of the survivors are drawn from a normal distribution curve.<br>

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
hist(d$zombies_killed)
qqnorm(d$zombies_killed, frame = FALSE)
qqline(d$zombies_killed)
```
<br>No, based on the graphs, the data does not stem from a normal distributions. This seems like the zombies killed by survivors data is drawn from a right-skewed distribution.<br>

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
hist(d$years_of_education)
qqnorm(d$years_of_education, frame = FALSE)
qqline(d$years_of_education)
```
<br>No, the data for survivors' years of education is not drawn from a normal disrtribution. The data is looks heavily right skewed.<br>


## 5. Now use the sample() function to sample ONE subset of 30 zombie survivors (without replacement) from this population and calculate the mean and sample standard deviation for each variable. Also estimate the standard error for each variable, and construct the 95% confidence interval for each mean. Note that for the variables that are not drawn from the normal distribution, you may need to base your estimate of the CIs on slightly different code than for the normal…
```{r}
(samplesized <- sample_n(d, size = 30, replace = FALSE))
(mean.height.s <- mean(samplesized$height))
(mean.weight.s <- mean(samplesized$weight))
(mean.age.s <- mean(samplesized$age))
(mean.kills.s <- mean(samplesized$zombies_killed))
(mean.edu.s <- mean(samplesized$years_of_education))

(sd.height.s <- pop.sd(samplesized$height))
(sd.weight.s <- pop.sd(samplesized$weight))
(sd.age.s <- pop.sd(samplesized$age))
(sd.kills.s <- pop.sd(samplesized$zombies_killed))
(sd.edu.s <- pop.sd(samplesized$years_of_education))

standarderror <- function(sd) {
  sd/sqrt(30)
}

(standarderror(sd.height.s))
(standarderror(sd.weight.s))
(standarderror(sd.age.s))
(standarderror(sd.kills.s))
(standarderror(sd.edu.s))
  
xbar = NULL
sd= NULL
bounds <- function(xbar , sd){
  t.score <- qt(p=0.05/2, df = 29,, lower.tail = FALSE)
  lower.bound <- xbar - (t.score * sd/sqrt(30))
  upper.bound <- xbar + (t.score * sd/sqrt(30))
  print(c(lower.bound, upper.bound))
}
  
bounds(mean.height.s, sd.height.s)
bounds(mean.weight.s, sd.weight.s)
bounds(mean.age.s, sd.age.s)
bounds(mean.kills.s, sd.kills.s)
bounds(mean.edu.s, sd.edu.s)


#Used this website to create bounds function: https://bookdown.org/logan_kelly/r_practice/p09.html
```
## Now draw 99 more random samples of 30 zombie apocalypse survivors, and calculate the mean for each variable for each of these samples. Together with the first sample you drew, you now have a set of 100 means for each variable (each based on 30 observations), which constitutes a sampling distribution for each variable. What are the means and standard deviations of this distribution of means for each variable? How do the standard deviations of means compare to the standard errors estimated in [5]? What do these sampling distributions look like (a graph might help here)? Are they normally distributed? What about for those variables that you concluded were not originally drawn from a normal distribution?

```{r}
meanheights <- c(mean.height.s)
meanweights <- c(mean.weight.s)
meanages <- c(mean.age.s)
meankills <- c(mean.kills.s)
meanedus <- c(mean.edu.s)



for (x in 1:99) { #create a loop that adds the mean vectors of the quantitative date to a vector of means
  rsample <- sample_n(d, size = 30, replace = FALSE)
  meanheights <- append(meanheights, mean(rsample$height))
  meanweights <- append(meanweights, mean(rsample$weight))
   meanages <- append(meanages, mean(rsample$age))
   meankills <- append(meankills, mean(rsample$zombies_killed))
   meanedus <- append(meanedus, mean(rsample$years_of_education))
}

meanheights
pop.sd(meanheights) #Use pop.sd because this set of 30 is our sample
meanweights
pop.sd(meanweights)
meanages
pop.sd(meanages)
meankills
pop.sd(meankills)
meanedus
```

<br>The standard deviations are smaller from this population are smaller than that of the one from Question 5.<br>

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
hist(meanheights) #makes a basic histogram
qqnorm(meanheights, frame = FALSE) #plots a qq graph 
qqline(meanheights) #plots qq line on the graph for analysis

par(mfrow = c(1,2))
hist(meanweights) 
qqnorm(meanweights, frame = FALSE)
qqline(meanweights)

par(mfrow = c(1,2))
hist(meanages)
qqnorm(meanages, frame = FALSE)
qqline(meanages)

par(mfrow = c(1,2))
hist(meankills)
qqnorm(meankills, frame = FALSE)
qqline(meankills) 

par(mfrow = c(1,2))
hist(meanedus)
qqnorm(meanedus, frame = FALSE)
qqline(meanedus)
```
<br>Based on th histograms and qqplots, they all seem more likely to be drawn from a normal distribution. However, mean weight is likely not drawn from normal distributed data.<br>
